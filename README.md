# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. The goal is to be the first player to place three of their symbols (either 'X' or 'O') in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Players take turns placing their marks in an empty cell, and the game continues until one player achieves the winning combination or all cells are filled, resulting in a draw if no one wins.

It's a simple and strategic game that emphasizes quick thinking and pattern recognition.
